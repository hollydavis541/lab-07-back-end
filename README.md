**Author**: Holly Davis and Natalie Alway

## Overview
Create a node.js server that connects to APIs that provide weather, events, restaurants, and movie showing information to the City Explorer site. 

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

This is a Node.js server that uses express, dotenv, and cors packages. The server currently references two json data files in order to provide information to the client. 

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
